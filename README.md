FLASHSTUDY

This project is the result of a two week sprint to showcase the skills I've gained as a fullstack developer thus far.  What you see here is a complete custom flashcard creator with the ability to Create, Edit or Play a deck of cards, which could easily be built out into a more robust system.

Built on a fountdation of T-SQL, personally written stored procedures, hand coded ADO.net commands, and a custom Web API created in the .NET framework written in C#.  The front end is written in REACTjs and Javascript, with only one major NPM package doing any front end work. (react-beautiful-dnd for the drag and drop list).  Everythig else is custom made, focusing primarily on the re-useability of components.
